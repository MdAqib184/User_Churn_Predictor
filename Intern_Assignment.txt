Churn Prediction Analysis
Approach
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
o The dataset was loaded and preprocessed to ensure quality and usability. This involved handling missing values and formatting the data to standardize input for model training.
o Feature scaling was applied to normalize data, which is essential for models like Logistic Regression.
2. Feature Engineering:
o New features were engineered to capture user activity patterns, such as purchase counts, total spend, and inactivity periods.
o Churn was defined based on a specific inactivity threshold (e.g., 30 days without activity), which aligns with business goals and user behavior patterns.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o Conducted thorough EDA to identify trends, correlations, and outliers in the dataset.
o Visualized distributions of key features such as purchase counts and event activity to better understand user behavior.
4. Model Building:
o Two models were built to predict churn: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
o Logistic Regression provided a baseline with interpretable coefficients, while Random Forest offered robust performance through its ensemble approach.
5. Model Evaluation:
o Models were evaluated using multiple metrics: 
* Classification Reports provided insights into precision, recall, and F1-score.
* ROC-AUC Scores assessed the models' ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn users.
* Confusion Matrices revealed model performance in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
6. Model Interpretation:
o SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were used to interpret the contributions of individual features to the models' predictions.
o Feature importance analysis highlighted the most influential factors, such as total spend and purchase counts.
7. Visualization:
o Plots of SHAP values and feature importance provided clear visualizations of how features influenced predictions.
o Partial dependence plots illustrated the relationship between key features and churn probability.
8. Recommendations:
o Formulated actionable recommendations based on the analysis to address user churn effectively.
Final Scores
Logistic Regression
* ROC-AUC: 1.0
* Accuracy: 100%
Random Forest
* ROC-AUC: 1.0
* Accuracy: 100%
Recommendations
1. Key Drivers of Churn:
o Analysis of feature importance from both models highlighted key churn drivers, such as users with lower purchase counts and reduced total spend.
2. Targeted Marketing Campaigns:
o Design targeted marketing campaigns to re-engage users exhibiting early signs of churn, particularly those with high event activity but no purchases.
3. Loyalty Programs and Discounts:
o Introduce loyalty programs or offer special discounts to encourage at-risk users to make purchases and improve retention rates.
4. Regular Monitoring:
o Continuously monitor user activity and adjust the churn threshold (e.g., 30 days of inactivity) to reflect evolving business needs and user behavior.
5. Personalized Strategies:
o Implement personalized product recommendations and incentive-based strategies to retain users by aligning with their preferences.
6. Utilizing SHAP Values:
o Leverage SHAP values and partial dependence plots to understand feature contributions and create more effective strategies for reducing churn.
7. Dynamic Thresholding:
o Evaluate and update the inactivity threshold regularly based on user behavior trends identified during the analysis.
8. Integration of EDA Insights:
o Use insights from the EDA to identify and address potential data quality issues, ensuring models are trained on high-quality inputs.

2. Model Overfitting:
o Risk of overfitting with complex models, leading to poor generalization on new data.
o Solution: Use cross-validation and regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting.
3. Scalability:
o Scaling the system to handle larger datasets or increased user activity.
o Solution: Adopt distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop or Spark.
By addressing these challenges and exploring future opportunities, the churn prediction framework can evolve into a more robust and versatile system, driving actionable insights and improved user retention.
